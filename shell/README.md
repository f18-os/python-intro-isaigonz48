# Python Shell Assignment

* Developed using python3, should work with previous versions (Used python3 because paths were not working for my linux on python 2.7)

* Supports any commands available on standard command line

* Supports simple (one) output redirection and input redirection

* Pipeline not supported, could not attach stdin and stdout to pipeline, but I think theory behind it is correct

* To exit the shell, type "exit"
